# Project 1 - Wine Quality Prediction Support Vector Machine

Utilized Python, pandas, and scikit-learn to build and optimize the predictive model.

🍷 Wine Quality Prediction - SVM Model
  This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The model is trained on wine characteristics and aims to classify wines based on their quality score.

📋 Features
  Machine Learning Model: Implements Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
  Wine Quality Prediction: Predicts wine quality based on physicochemical attributes such as acidity, alcohol, and sugar levels.
  Data Processing: Data is preprocessed and normalized for better model performance.
  Visualization: Includes data visualization to understand feature importance and distribution.
